Hello 2017! Today I had brunch with my cousins, played a new board game with them all (makes me think I need to buy more board games), and cleaned all of my makeup brushes. I'm doing this year in review and reseting my goals for the year :) Feeling pretty good about a fresh start and getting my things together after a less-productive end of the year.

I had the day off of work today! My Mom and Dad put in some videos of our family from when I was a baby (literally I was 1 year old and a few months in all of the videos). They were *so cute* to watch :)

Back to the gym today to train with Louis. OMG he kicked my ass so much today. I'm kind of scared for tomorrow because honestly I could barely stand by the end of that lower-body workout. But it felt super super good to be back in the gym :)

I was pretty productive today! I had this idea for an app-thing I wanted to build to generate random hackathon ideas and ended up using Vue.js for the first time and stringing together a few modules pretty fast to get something running. It felt pretty good to go from idea to creation so fast. And its been a while since I built something, too.

It snowed today right as I was heading out to go to the gym. And when I finished my workout, the car was covered in it and the air was super fresh and I felt really good. It was so pretty outside :)

I went to a "wedding" dinner party today for Anna & Igor (who legally got married today but are having their actual wedding and reception later in the year). It was so cute :) and great to see this group of people I don't get to hang out with very often. Much food, a few games, and a bit of catching up. Was super nice.

Today was "move-in" day for my New York apartment in Brooklyn! It started snowing *hard* on the drive up (ended up being 7 inches!) but we prevailed, unloaded the car, and built a bunch of IKEA furniture. It was super productive. The highlight of the day was probably the dinner we had at Cafe Luluc. OMG it was so good. I got seafood soup and it ended up being a ton of mussels, shrimp, and lobster, and then got duck which was also *on pointe* and they even brought us complimentary creme brule! WOWOW. It was impressive. The service was also unbelievable (also helped that not many people were there due to the huge snow storm, but still), all in all, fantastic day.

I got breakfast in this cute place called Smile Cafe with my parents this morning before going back to my apartment to build the last shelving unit. It was all pretty efficient :) I'm happy to have gotten it all done.

Last workout with Louis! It was a fun one. We focused on deadlifting. SO many deadlifts! :P But I ended up lifting 145 lbs for 6 reps at one point, which isn't too bad. I'm going to miss Louis so much when I'm off to NY again.

Tonight was my grandpa's 80th birthday! We went to this Uzbek restaurant my family frequents, and the food was yummy and I got to see a lot of my family there too.

Tonight was Manhattan JS! My first one! It was such a great event, and I left it very inspired to build things. One of the talks was about data visualization and describing the entire process. Was super inspiring. And Rachel did an electronics talk, and now I'm all :) ahh need to build something.

Today Patricia and I had to take out the recycling, and we had a *lot* of big boxes from the furniture we had gotten, so we ended up throwing them down the stairs. It was actually a *lot* of fun to watch them go flying :P It was my first night in the new apartment too!

Today was Earl's going-away drinks. Afterward, I met up with Tim to get some dinner. During the wait, we met this Australian couple(?) who chatted with us a while and started up this questions game (our answers were supposed to reveal something about ourselves). :P That was fun, and food was great (cute little place in the East Village), and then we got absinthe and melted into the seats of this bar as we talked about life. Afterward, we went to my place where I gave Tim a Stromae-education. Not a bad night.

I got brunch with my coworker this morning at Pietro Nolita--this entirely pink little restaurant near where the corporate apartment is. It was so cute! And very instagrammable :P Then I went on a little adventure with Patricia in search of kitchen ware at restaurant supply stores.

I joined CitiBike Share this morning :) and rode around a bit and then saw Arrival with Tim at the Alamo Drafthouse! Ahh it made me so happy to be biking again and also that the Alamo Drafthouse is so close to me :D It's about equidistant from me here than the one in Austin was.

I went on a date today at a shuffleboard place called the Royal Palms-- like real full-size shuffleboard. It was a lot of fun :) I wasn't great at it, but it's fine. We also played connect four and then headed to a bar on my street. Love this neighborhood.

We recorded Toolsday with Glenn Maddern today. It was so good to hear his perspective on things and the after-recording discussion about CSS was really good. Also just nice to catch up :) Reminds me why I love Toolsday so much.

Today was BrooklynJS! Which was really good. I got to meet Sarah from makeupconf who did a great talk about diagrams in documentation and learning styles. Hanging out afterward was nice too  :)

Went on a second date today with Stepan. We got drinks at Lumos, this small SoHo bar with *great* cocktails, and then went to see a Broadway show, Waitress. Then we went to the Blind Barber (finally made it here) and I ended up getting home at 3:30AM. One of those nights.

Today I went over to John Resig's house with a small group to play board games. It was a lot of fun :) I forgot how much I love to play board games and he made some really good food for us. I left and bought one called Sushi Go on my way home.

There was a Software for Artists Day (like a small conference) at Pioneer Works today. A lot of really cool projects were exhibited! Definitely left feeling inspired and wanting to do more.

I finally finished setting up service workers for my blog to have offline save capabilities. The post was published today and got a lot of really positive feedback. I'm so glad I finally did this!

DigitalOcean had a company event where they rented out a theatre for us to all watch Hidden Figures at. It was a great event :) So much food though!

After work today we had a happy hour for one of the people temporarily leaving the NYC office. Afterward, I went to see a midnight showing of the Big Lebowski with Pat and Tim. Definitely a fun but unexpected end to the night.

This morning I got breakfast tacos at Tacombi with two of my coworkers who are staying in the corporate housing with me. They're so yumm there and my coworkers are awesome :)

Today I stayed in bed because I'm sick most of the day, but I did watch the Little Prince on Netflix, which is really cute, and beautifully illustrated movie.
