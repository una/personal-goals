### Week in Review:
It was a pretty good week. I learned some fun facts. I.e. $0 in Chrome always points to the selected element and $1 selects the last selected element. And learned about Git interactive rebasing (albeit I messed up on this). I also began to learn Angular with egghead.io :) and spent way too much of my weekend on it. I set up a DigitalOcean account and submitted my first PR to an open source project(!). I didn't get to all of the specific things I had planned, but I did a lot of others as they popped up, so it was a pretty good week!
