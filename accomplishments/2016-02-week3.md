### Week in Review

This past week was really awesome and very productive too. I worked a lot on the IBM SXSW Party Radio Jukebox app with a coworker, and also finished the blog post which was my week's focus. In addition, I did some more fun CSS things like a little carnival game in pure CSS. It was a really full but great week, and I put a lot on my plate for next week as well. Woo!
